                            Ambassador Sun Gongyi informed Prime Minister Jugnauth of the latest situation of the pneumonia outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus in China and the progress made by the Chinese government in taking responsible and effective measures, saying that under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government and people have the confidence and capability to overcome various difficulties and finally overcome the abrupt and unexpected outbreak. Although the WHO declared the outbreak an "public health emergency of international concern", it was not directed at China. There was no reason to take unnecessary measures to interfere with international travel and trade. It is hoped that Mauritius can fully follow and respect WHO's professional recommendations when formulating its defense control measure.
