Subject matter and technology experts will meet February 28 through March 1, 2020 in the Colonel John C. Robinson American Center in Addis Ababa to brainstorm and generate an open-source, free, and easy-to-learn technology solution for social good.

The U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa is partnering with Google Developers’ Group of Addis Ababa (DGD Addis) in implementing this project. We hope this event will encourage aspiring developers to solve community problems through technology.
