According to Global Market Insights (https://bit.ly/33hukg6), “Europe Cloud Computing Market size exceeded USD 25 Billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at over 12% CAGR between 2019 and 2026.” Epazz sees COVID-19 as a permanent shift in how cloud software applications are being used in companies’ operations. DeskFlex will benefit from the shift as companies are having employees work part time from the office. According to Market Research (https://bit.ly/3bHP1WD), “The shift from on-premise to public cloud solutions to manage, optimize, automate, and monitor enterprise applications and business services was already prevalent in Europe. COVID-19 has accelerated this cloud journey even further.”



DeskFlex’s room scheduling system continues to upgrade its software features to help curb the positive cases of Coronavirus contamination in hotspot countries such as the US and Europe. DeskFlex conference room booking software helps schools, offices, companies and organizations get back to the normal activities by implementing new practices and health protocols.
