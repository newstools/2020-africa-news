                            NTT Pro Cycling’s (NTTProCycling.com) Giacomo Nizzolo sprinted to an excellent third place in stage three of the Tour de France, in a display bristling with fight and superb team work.



The stage was ultimately won by Caleb Ewan (LTS) in a perfectly timed finale by the Australian, ahead of Sam Bennett (DQT) with Nizzolo third.

It was a very good day overall from NTT Pro Cycling, who took a main role in the lead-up from as early as 35km out and also safely steered Domenico Pozzovivo home, as he continues to suffer from the injuries he sustained on the first day of the race.

I’m definitely happy about the commitment of the guys, we did everything we could. Obviously in the final it could have been better for us but it also could have definitely been worse. I had to start the sprint early because I was scared that if I dropped the speed that we would be caught from behind so it was a super long sprint but performance-wise I’m happy and I think that in the team we are really looking forward to the next sprint.

I’m feeling alright, definitely better than yesterday. It was a long stage and a little bit of bad weather but it wasn’t too tough fortunately. The team worked well together and we were on the podium so not a bad result at all.

From the beginning we’ve know that Giacomo is really, really strong and he’s on good form. Unfortunately there was a bit of bad luck on the first stage but today he proved that he’s strong and if we keep knocking on the door eventually it’s going to open.
