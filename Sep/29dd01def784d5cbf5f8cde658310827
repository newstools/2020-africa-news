                            Stage 16 of the Tour de France saw Lennard Kamna (BOH) solo to an impressive victory after earlier playing an active role in forming the day’s breakaway that finally stuck.



NTT Pro Cycling’s (NTTProCycling.com) riders tried valiantly in a fast and furious opening 50km stretch to assist in forming the break – with Michael Gogl, Michael Valgren and Edvald Boasson Hagen all particularly active.
                                It was frustrating for us not to be in the break but we have two more opportunities and it’s a lot more motivation for us to be in those breaks
                            

The day’s racing then saw the team all ride safely home conserving energy ahead of what promises to be some tough days to come.

It was quite a hard start and we were really motivated to be in the break but especially being two riders down it was quite tough, especially when the stage starts uphill.

We fought and fought and I’m not sure if the coverage shows it all but there was a lot going on between the peloton and the front group for a long time. But eventually that was that and the break went and unfortunately we weren’t represented; from there the peloton was pretty relaxed for the last two climbs.

It was frustrating for us not to be in the break but we have two more opportunities and it’s a lot more motivation for us to be in those breaks. I think we spent a lot in the beginning but ultimately being in the bunch sees that we have saved some energy.
