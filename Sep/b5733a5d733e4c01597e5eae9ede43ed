NICE, France, September 1, 2020/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            Stage four of the 2020 Tour de France saw the race’s first mountain-top finish. NTT Pro Cycling’s (NTTProCycling.com) plan for the day hinged primarily on guiding climber Domenico Pozzovivo into the finale in order for him to maintain his steady position on the overall race classification.



The stage was won by Primoz Roglic (TJV) with Tadej Pogacar (UAE) in second place, and Gullaime Martin (COF) completed the podium.

Pozzovivo finished 34th just over a minute behind Roglic but crucially came through the stage without doing any further damage to the injuries that he sustained on the opening stage of the race.

All of riders safely navigated their way home and will now be looking at rest and recovery ahead of stage five, which could well be an opportunity for the sprinters again.

I think it was a case of “job done” today. It was a pretty hard day in the peloton, Quickstep took control and it was a pretty grippy day but it was just to get through and keep Pozzo in the front; that’s what we did and now we look forward to tomorrow.

Now it’s just time to rest and recover for what hopefully will be an opportunity to sprint again.

Today was actually a super hard day. Quickstep were pulling quite hard so it wasn’t a day you enjoyed as the first mountaintop finish, especially for me.

But we tried to set up Pozzo as well as possible and I think he’s doing pretty well if you consider how hurt he is.
