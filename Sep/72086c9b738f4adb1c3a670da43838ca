                            The 2020 Tour de France sees NTT Pro Cyling (NTTProCycling.com) celebrate 10 years of partnership with the Qhubeka Charity. A short film celebrating this moment was shown to our riders on the eve of the race, and has since also seen some of the "behind the scenes" footage from the team in Nice added in celebration of this milestone.
