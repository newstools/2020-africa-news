TRIPOLI, Libya, September 16, 2020/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            A group of Libyan healthcare professionals from across the country met in Tripoli, Benghazi and Sebha to participate via a video teleconference in the first of a series of UN-supported technical exchanges to combat COVID-19. The aim of the initiative by Libyan healthcare professionals, which is supported by the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and undertaken in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO), is to strengthen the response to COVID-19 and discuss, at the technical-level, ways to address gaps in service delivery.  These discussions will help increase awareness around needs and response planning on COVID-19 issues seeking to build longer-term mechanisms for public health cooperation across the country.
                                The participants committed to cooperating across the country and with international parties to combat and reduce the threat of COVID-19
                            



During the first consultation session held on 12 September, 28 participants from cities across the country identified needs and discussed joint initiatives to enhance prevention, detection, and management response. The participants committed to cooperating across the country and with international parties to combat and reduce the threat of COVID-19. Highlighting the prevalent security risks and violence faced by medical workers, they called on all Libyans to respect and protect their healthcare workers. 

UNSMIL is encouraged by the unity of purpose and commitment demonstrated by the group which will re-convene within two weeks to continue their effort.
