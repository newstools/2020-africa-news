DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, April 14, 2020/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            For the 31st year, Canon Europe (www.Canon-Europe.com) is proud to announce it will partner with Visa pour l’Image, one of the world’s leading photojournalism festivals. Taking place in Perpignan, France, between 29th August – 13th September 2020, this long-standing partnership highlights Canon’s commitment to photojournalism, from students learning the craft to professionals breaking boundaries.



This prestigious festival brings together the world’s most important stories and those responsible for telling them. Once again, Canon celebrates its partnership at Visa pour l’Image 2020 with three exciting initiatives: Canon Female Photojournalist Grant, Canon Student Development Programme and the inaugural Canon Video Grant.



Amine Djouhara, Sales and Marketing Director at CCNA said: “As a leading Company in imaging we are proud to support the vision and creativity of many professionals working in the field today. We also actively partner with forums like Visa Pour L’Image for celebrating professionals and supporting the discovery of future visionaries in imaging. This year we are particularly proud that for the first time we have an opportunity to include African students in the competition. This is an opportunity to potentially feature the results of our Miraisha initiative that educated young people in imaging. I strongly urge photography students and professionals to use the lockdown period to compile their portfolios and submit them for this once in a lifetime opportunity.



Canon Video Grant: 

This year marks the inaugural Canon Video Grant, run in conjunction with Visa pour l’Image and in association with Images Evidence – for which a videographer, or photographer, will be awarded a grant of €8,000 alongside the loan of pioneering Canon video kit to produce a short-film documentary. Projects should cover cultural, social or economic subjects and applicants will be judged on the presentation of their project alongside their previous work.



Journalistic thoughts and relevance of the story, or chosen subject, will be at the forefront of the judge’s minds when reviewing entries. A teaser of the winning project will be presented during one of the evening screening shows at the September 2020 festival, with the complete and final video report being screened at Visa pour l’Image one year later. The application deadline has been extended to 31st May 2020.
