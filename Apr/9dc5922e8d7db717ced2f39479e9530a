CAPE TOWN, South Africa, April 3, 2020/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            The National Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni of Department Small Business Development has clarified the issue relating to the operations of informal traders this morning on an interview with SAFM as per amended Regulations and Directives issued last week.  The Minister indicated that spaza-shops and informal traders selling vegetables and fruits with approved permits from their local municipalities are allowed to operate within the residential areas.  It should be noted that each spaza shop must have its own permit meaning that those owning more should apply for each shop. Local Economic Development (LED) officials from Local Municipalities are on board in terms of issuance of permits.



Government has emphasized the list of goods that fall within the essential products which include amongst others food (including non-alcoholic beverages), cleaning and hygiene products, medical, fuel and basic goods such as airtime and electricity.
                                The Department urges spaza shop owners to adhere to the health precautionary measures by sanitizing their shops and also avail some for customers to prevent the spread of COVID-19
