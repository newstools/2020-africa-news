The National Health Emergency Committee, under the Ministry of Health, continues to lead the response, supported by the UN system and other partners like MÃ©decins Sans Frontieres. The Committee holds daily coordination meetings, as well as daily briefings to the press and the general public about the outbreak. In support of the National Contingency Plan, the UN has developed a UN joint COVID-19 Operational Support Plan.
