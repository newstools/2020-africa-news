                            3 new coronavirus cases were identified today, out of 720 samples tested in the last 24 hours. This brings the total number of confirmed cases to 113 (of whom 7 have recovered).




	2 travelers with recent travel history in the region, who were quarantined upon arrival
	1 contact of a previously confirmed positive case, who was identified through tracing




All new cases have been isolated and the tracing of contacts is ongoing. All patients are under treatment in stable condition in designated health facilities. The majority are asymptomatic, and no patient is in critical condition.

Heightened vigilance continues to be required. The extension of the enhanced prevention measures announced by the Government of Rwanda must be rigorously observed. Any Rwandans or legal residents returning to the country will be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine at designated locations.

Continue to observe the instructions of health authorities, particularly washing hands regularly and maintaining physical distance from other people (at least 1 metre).

The key symptoms of coronavirus are dry cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should call the toll-free number 114, or dial *114# for automated screening, or email callcenter@rbc.gov.rw, or send a WhatsApp message to +250 788 20 20 80, or contact a medical professional.

Let's continue to work together to defeat this pandemic.
