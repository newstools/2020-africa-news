	Stay alone in their rooms, away from the rest of the family.
	Use a mask if they have flu and visitors should not be allowed into the patient's room, until discharged.
	Use dedicated linen and eating utensils for the patient and these items should be cleaned with soap and water after use and may be re-used instead of being discarded.
	The patient is not expected to travel to societal gatherings and public places.




Further emphasis is made on the practice of regular hand wash with soap and water as well as covering mouth and nose using tissue when coughing or sneezing.

The Ministry of Health will continue updating the nation on further developments.
