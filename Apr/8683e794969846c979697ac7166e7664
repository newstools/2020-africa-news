As of 9 am EAT 14 April 2020, a total of 15,284 COVID-19 cases and 816 (CFR: 5%) deaths have been reported in 52 African countries. Out of 52 Member States that have reported cases, six have community transmission, 44 have local transmission and two have imported cases only. Since the last brief, the number of COVID-19 cases has increased by 52% (5,198 cases). The five countries in Africa with the highest cumulative number of cases (proportion of reported cases in Africa) are South Africa (2,272; 15%), Egypt (2,190; 14%) Algeria (1,914; 13%), Morocco (1,763;

12%) and Cameroon (820; 5%). When population is taken into consideration, Djibouti (30.2), Mauritius(25.5), Seychelles (11.2), Tunisia (6.1), and Morocco (4.8) are reporting the most cases per 100,000 population within the continent. Fifteen countries are reporting case fatality rates higher than the global case fatality rate of 6%. See Table 1 for the full list of countries in Africa reporting  cases,  deaths,  and  COVID-19  recoveries  in  addition  to  transmission  type  being reported. Africa CDC is working with all affected countries and is mobilizing laboratory, surveillance, and other response support where requested.

NEW Africa CDC Response Activities:

Surveillance:


	AFTCOR’s weekly surveillance technical working group met on 1 April 2020 to strategize on innovative ways to provide remote technical capacity and improved policy recommendations to Member States, backed up by Member State data, in this era of closed borders and restricted movement.
	Africa CDC will start holding weekly disease surveillance webinars on priority topics, like early detection and containment of COVID-19 cases, to support technical teams within the AU Member States’ ministries and governments. The English and French Webinar were launched on Wednesday (8 April) and Tuesday (14 April), respectively.
	Africa CDC will host the second weekly disease surveillance webinar on "Understanding the WHO First Few Cases (FFX) protocol and the Case record form (“know your epidemic”)” and “How to use Go data” on Wednesday 15 April 2020 for English speaking countries and Friday 17 April 2020 for French speaking countries at (16:00-17:00 hours EAT).




Healthcare Preparedness

1. Africa CDC initiated a continent-wide network of 300 clinicians from across the continent to discuss COVID-19 clinical management and is holding weekly webinars. The next webinar is scheduled for 16 April 2020 to discuss management of frontline healthcare workers.

Recommendations for Member States:


	All Member States should enhance their existing surveillance7 to include COVID-198 and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI)9 or pneumonia cases. Examples of enhanced surveillance include:

	
		Adding questions about travel, contact history, and testing for coronaviruses to existing influenza surveillance systems;
		Notifying healthcare facilities to immediately inform local public health officials about persons who meet the case definition for COVID-19, SARI and/or have recent travel to a country with local transmission or history of contact with a case.
	
	
	Member States should continue to enhance surveillance at the borders to screen incoming travelers for severe respiratory illness and a history of recent travel to affected countries or territories reporting local or community transmission. Member States should
	Member States should perform contact tracing of confirmed cases based on transmission type and country capacity.10
	Notify WHO and Africa CDC immediately if suspected or confirmed cases of infection with novel coronavirus are identified. Africa CDC should be notified by emailing AfricaCDCEBS@africa-union.org.
	Provide guidance to the general public about seeking immediate medical care and informing healthcare providers about recent travel or contact history in anyone who develops symptoms of severe respiratory illness.
