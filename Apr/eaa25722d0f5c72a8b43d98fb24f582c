                            Due to the shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to curb the spread of COVID-19, the National Treasury in support of the Department of Trade, Industry, and Competition (DTIC) calls on all compliant, particularly local, suppliers providing commodities listed below to direct their offers to the PMO set up for this purpose. The submissions will be assessed by the support team responsible for coordinating the process, exclusively for the identified commodities.

	Disposable aprons
	Protective surgical gowns
	Protective eyewear
	Surgical gloves
	Overshoes
	Protective hoods
	Biohazard bags
	Ventilators
	Alcohol-Cleaning, disinfectants – clinical
	Venturi mask


Detailed information should be provided for the above items and submitted directly to the email covid19supplies@businessresponsecovid19.co.za.

The submission should include the following information:


	Supplier name,

	Indication of products that can be supplied.


National Treasury continues to advise suppliers to be vigilant during this time and not submit their information to would-be scammers. Suppliers are advised to always first verify with relevant departments before supplying any goods.

The submission through this process does not in any manner or form waive the requirements for compliance outlined in the Central Supplier Database (CSD).
