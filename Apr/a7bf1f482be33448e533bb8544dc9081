ABUJA, Nigeria, April 13, 2020/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            On Easter Sunday, April 12th, 2020, Nigeria joined its other OPEC+ counterparts to bring into effect the agreement to cut 9.7 Million Barrels of supply following the alignment of Mexico. The intervention of the United States of America resulted in Mexico agreeing to a cut of 100 KBOPD and to be complemented by an additional 300 KBOPD by US Producers. This will enable the rebalancing of the oil markets and the expected rebound of prices by $15 per barrel in the short term.  This also promises an appropriate balancing of Nigeria’s 2020 budget that has been rebased at $30 per barrel.
