SunMirror's plan to have its shares quoted on the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges aims at increasing visibility and tradability for its investors, amidst an unprecedented and sustained "bull run" in strategic resources like gold, lithium and beyond. "By doing so, we wish to offer partner investors the possibility of investing in SunMirror and gain exposure to our unique growth story," says Dr Heinz Rudolf Kubli, a Director of SunMirror AG.

At a recent investor roundtable, Kubli presented SunMirrror's prospects in economic terms. "When we see how technology is driving consumer and industrial demand for innovation, which in turn, is powering global growth everywhere, we then see clearly the enabling role SunMirror can play in helping to supply raw materials for this historic transformation."

SunMirror continues to attract renowned partners for both the intended listing on national and international exchanges, as well as its future capital markets activities. Fulfilling its function as Lead Advisor, Opus Capital Switzerland AG was entrusted with structuring transactions and evaluating investors.
