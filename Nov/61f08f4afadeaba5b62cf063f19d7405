Kwik Delivery and Total Nigeria Plc will enable businesses to use TOTAL service stations as secure pickup locations of essential documents issued by the Corporate Affairs Commission to Nigerian businesses, such as Certificates of Incorporation or CAC 1.1. forms.

The Nigerian Corporate Affairs Commission is regularly innovating to improve its services to businesses and has recently decided to add a complete delivery and pick-up service in order to streamline the issuance of its documents to Nigerian businesses.

“Drop off & pick-up locations are essential to the development of e-commerce in Nigeria and TOTAL’s service stations have a great role to play thanks to their trusted brand and quality service. We are glad to partner with Kwik Delivery on this essential service to Nigerian businesses” said Charles Atiomo, General Manager, Sales & Marketing Division of Total Nigeria Plc.

“This partnership is a great step toward establishing an e-commerce infrastructure that stakeholders can trust and rely on” explains Romain POIROT-LELLIG, Founder & CEO of Kwik Delivery. “We are honoured to inaugurate this service in partnership with Total Nigeria Plc and its dense network of strategically-located outlets.”
