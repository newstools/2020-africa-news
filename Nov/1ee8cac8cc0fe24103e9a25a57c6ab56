Merck Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Merck KGaA Germany announced the winners of “Stay at Home” Media Recognition Awards for African Countries, Latin American, and Asian Countries for their best media coverage of coronavirus. The main objective of these awards is to raise awareness on ‘How to Stay Safe and Keep Physically and Mentally Healthy during Coronavirus Lockdown’ with the aim to separate facts from myths and misconceptions.  

The “Stay at Home” Media Recognition Awards for Africa were introduced in partnership with African First Ladies of Ghana, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Malawi, Namibia, Niger, Guinea Conakry, Burundi, Central African Republic (C.A.R.), Chad, Zimbabwe, Zambia, The Gambia, Liberia and Congo Brazzaville, Angola and Mozambique.

Dr. Rasha Kelej, CEO of Merck Foundation emphasizes, “I am very proud of all our winners. We received a very good response from the journalists. I truly believe that Media plays a crucial role in educating and sensitizing our communities about health and sensitive topics and not only during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, through the awards, we are recognizing the distinguished reportage and the exceptional work of journalists who have the potential to break the silence and be the storytellers and the voice or the voiceless so that they become Merck Foundation Champions to help us to eliminate infertility stigma and empower girls through education in developing countries and underserved communities”. 

“Therefore, we welcome the winners as Merck Foundation Alumni, and hope that they will be working together to create a culture shift as a part of ‘Merck More than a Mother’ and ‘Educating Linda’ programs”, Rasha Kelej added.

Merck Foundation also rewarded all the winners by providing them with one-year access to an online educational training program called “MasterClass”. The MasterClass is an immersive online experience and self-paced learning course in English that can be accessed anywhere with the Internet.
