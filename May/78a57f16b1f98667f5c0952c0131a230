On behalf of the Government, the Minsanté welcomed the republican gesture and the citizen's approach in the response against Covid-19 by these two structures. In his speech, noting a certain relaxation of the populations following the relaxation of certain measures taken by the Head of State in relation to the Covid, Dr MANAOUDA Malachie took the opportunity to recall that the Covid-19 is not yet finished. Therefore, he recommended that the populations should continue to show a lot of responsibility and discipline in the observance of barrier measures to deal with it.

Today's gesture, the umpteenth of its kind, will reinforce the efforts made so far by the Government in the response.
