MALABO, Equatorial Guinea, May 21, 2020/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            The Equal by 30 Campaign aims to advance gender equality and ensure women have the same opportunities as men in the energy industry.







The Equal by 30 campaign is a joint initiative of the Clean Energy, Education and Empowerment Initiative (C3E), which works to advance the participation of women in the clean energy transition and close the gender gap, and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The Equal by 30 campaign aims to have public and private sector commitments to work towards equal pay, equal leadership and equal opportunities for women in the clean energy sector by 2030.
                                We have the firm conviction that a society that excludes and neglects half of its population can never reach its full potential and it’s condemned to failure in the long run
                            



Our vision is framed in the dream of a strong, dynamic and innovative Africa and Equatorial Guinea, manifested through the strength of its companies and its businessmen and businesswoman.



“We have the firm conviction that a society that excludes and neglects half of its population can never reach its full potential and it’s condemned to failure in the long run” Said Leoncio AMADA NZE, Founder and CEO of Apex Industries
