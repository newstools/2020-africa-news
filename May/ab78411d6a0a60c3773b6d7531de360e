In September 2019, UNHCR opened a sub-office in Maradi to coordinate registration, protection, education, health, housing and access to WASH services. A key feature of the UNHCR response is the relocation of refugees to villages of opportunity away from the border, to ensure their safety and ease the pressure on host populations. This program also contributes to the development of rural areas which lack basic infrastructure and services, in line with the humanitarian-development nexus.
