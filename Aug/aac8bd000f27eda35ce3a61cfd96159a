PARIS, France, August 27, 2020/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            Giacomo Nizzolo, racing for the Italian national team, sprinted to victory at the European Road Race Championships, taking the win ahead of Arnaud Demare (France) and Pascal Ackermann (Germany).



After winning the Italian national title on Sunday, Giacomo Nizzolo backed that championship winning ride up with another today, by winning the European road race title.
                                I am so happy, and I can't wait to see the team tonight and to celebrate with them
                            

The Italian team started the 177km circuit race in Plouay, France with a clear plan to deliver Nizzolo to the line, a plan which they were able to execute to perfection.

Nizzolo jumped out from behind his final leadout man, Davide Ballerini (who finished 2nd to Nizzolo in the nationals on Sunday), in the final 150m of the race to edge out Arnaud Demare for the win.

The Italian sprinter is set to lead our NTT Pro Cycling lineup at the Tour de France, starting this Saturday in Nice, and will do so proudly in the European Continental Champions jersey.

Giacomo Nizzolo - Team Italy & NTT Pro Cycling
Today was incredible. Italy road all day in the front, from the first kilometre and controlled the race. I had good feelings throughout the race and in the end could do a great sprint. I am so happy, and I can't wait to see the team tonight and to celebrate with them.
