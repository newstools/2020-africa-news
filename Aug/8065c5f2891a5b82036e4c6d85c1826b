Stilian Shishkov, Founder and CEO of Sportal commented on the launch: “Africa is a very important milestone for us and a great opportunity to partner with Pulse in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and Senegal. Africa is not just another growth market, but a continent with a young population that is highly engaged with sports, football in particular. We are super excited to work with a truly pan-African organization such as Pulse and introduce Sportal365 as another pillar in their cutting edge digital services portfolio. This new integration also strengthens our partnership with leading Swiss media company Ringier, backers of Pulse."

The partnership is to kick off with integrations on Pulse.ng/sports; Pulse.com.gh/sports; Pulselive.co.ke/sports and Pulse.sn/sports this month and will look to attract partners wanting to reach sports fans.

Moritz Boullenger, Director of Technology of Pulse and MD of Pulse Nigeria: "We are always looking for ways to improve our websites' usability. With Sportal's expertise in rich sports content, combined with their expertise in serving advertisers optimally in the space, we will be able to bring a fantastic experience to Pulse’s sports loving audience."
