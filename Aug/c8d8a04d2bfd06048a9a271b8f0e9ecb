The number deaths associated to COVID-19 is increasing in many more countries even those which used to report low deaths. As of 29 July 2020, 15 countries are reporting a case fatality rate (CFR) which is higher than the African Continent CFR of 1.68%. Chad (8.13%), Liberia (6.17%), Niger (6.10%), Mali (4.93%) and Burkina Faso (4.79%) are the tope five countries that report the highest CFR.

Due to the combined effects of food insecurity and COVID-19, as well as the locust threat, the number of people in need of emergency food assistance could climb to 57.6 million people in the Sahel and West Africa countries from July to August 2020 (Source: WFP). On 17 July, UNICEF and WFP joined forces to issue an alert on the unprecedented impact of food insecurity and COVID-19 on child malnutrition, warning of more than 15 million expected cases of acute malnutrition in 2020.
