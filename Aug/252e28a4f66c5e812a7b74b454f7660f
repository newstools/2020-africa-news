                            The Czech Tour will get underway on Thursday, 6 August, starting with a team time trial. The race comprises of 4 stages in total, ending on Sunday 9 August.



Victor Campenaerts will headline the NTT Pro Cycling (NTTProCycling.com) lineup at the Czech Tour, as the Belgian gets his 2020 racing season back on track after the Covid-19 pandemic put a stop to all racing since March this year.
                                I am looking forward to getting back to racing and to getting back to being with the team, and also to be racing with the team
                            

Campenaerts will be joined by teammates Reinardt Janse van Rensburg, Jay Thomson, Nic Dlamini, Andreas Stokbro, Michael Carbel and Matteo Sobrero for the 4-stage race.

The opening team time trial covers a distance of 18km, and so a strong team performance will lay the foundations for anyone hoping to mount a challenge for the general classification.

However, the difference can easily be made on the following three stages as an undulating terrain on each of the respective stages will encourage constant attacking.

"I am looking forward to getting back to racing and to getting back to being with the team, and also to be racing with the team, which is always slightly different than just being on training camp with each other. We have a team well suited to an attacking style of racing and the Czech Tour parcour will give opportunities to aggressive riding, so I am keen to be aggressive and hopefully we can win a stage."
