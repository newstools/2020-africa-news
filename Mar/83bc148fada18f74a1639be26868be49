NEW Africa CDC Response Activities:



Laboratory


	The distribution of test kits from the Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy-Jack Ma & Alibaba Foundations Initiative has been completed in Member States. Africa CDC is following the validation of the new testing protocol with Member States
	 Africa CDC is planning for distribution of additional 40,000 tests to countries that are in critical need.
	In collaboration with ASLM, a community of practice (online training program) was conducted on March 25. More than 110 participants attended and the forum helped to address some frequently asked questions and to provide guidance on the laboratory testing issues.
	Shipment of Oxford Nanonpore Technologies equipment and reagents has started to build capacity in seven Member States. Online training will be organized once shipment is completed.
	Africa CDC completed an equipment footprint analysis across the continent for GeneXpert, similarly for Roche and Abbott platforms. The projected testing needs for GeneXpert have been submitted to the company.
	Shortage of viral transport media, swabs and extraction kits is now the main challenge to expanding testing. Africa CDC is looking for all possible sources for these items and will update the Member States when items are available.




Healthcare Preparedness


	Africa CDC initiated a continent-wide network of clinicians which met for the first time on 9 March 2020 and has been holding weekly webinars including ~300 clinicians from across the continent. The next webinar is scheduled for 2 April 2020.
	Africa CDC has established an online portal with training materials via online courses, online case studies, and social media vignettes to support evidence-based care of COVID-19 patients.




Risk Communication


	Africa CDC continues to provide and receive updated information about the outbreak through the WhatsApp groups created for Member States communication officers and journalists. Twenty-seven journalists have been added to the media group in the last week.
	Africa CDC produced two podcasts to provide information about the outbreak
	Africa CDC held discussions with the Facebook team to enhance Africa CDC campaigns and messaging for COVID-19. Full proposals about this will be submitted by Facebook for consideration.
	Africa CDC transitioned to a new Africa CDC website which provides access to more information about COVID-19 from Africa CDC
	Africa CDC is working on a rumour tracking system for Africa CDC to monitor, aggregate, and respond to rumours, mis- and dis-information, and misconceptions about COVID-19
	 Africa CDC is collaborating with the Co-Creation Hub (CcHUB), the leading technology innovation Centre in Africa, to launch a call for innovative communication projects on COVID-19 based on African languages targeted at the semi-urban and rural population across Africa. The communication projects are expected to help counter disbelief and misinformation, catalyse citizens actions and solidarity as well as combat stigmatization.
	Africa CDC is initiating a collaboration with Resolve to Save Lives, WHO, and a private opinion research company to survey attitudes and behaviors regarding COVID-19 and community social distancing. Reports will be provided to Member States after the initial round of surveys.




Recommendations for Member States: 


	All Member States should enhance their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns of SARI or pneumonia cases. Examples of enhanced surveillance include: 
	
		Adding questions about travel and testing for coronaviruses to existing influenza surveillance systems;
		Notifying healthcare facilities to immediately inform local public health officials about persons who meet the case definition for SARI and/or have recent travel or contact history with someone who has traveled to a country with local transmission.
	
	
	Member States that receive direct or connecting flights from affected countries should screen incoming passengers for severe respiratory illness and a history of recent travel to any country/area or territory reporting local transmission. Member States should be prepared to expand questions about recent travel to additional countries as the outbreak evolves. 
	Notify WHO and Africa CDC immediately if suspected or confirmed cases of infection with novel coronavirus are identified. Africa CDC should be notified by emailing AfricaCDCEBS@africa-union.org. 
	Provide guidance to the general public about seeking immediate medical care and informing healthcare providers about recent travel or contact history in anyone who develops symptoms of severe respiratory illness.
