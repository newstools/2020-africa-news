On his part, UNAMID’s Joint Special Representative (JSR), Jeremiah Mamabolo reflected on the ongoing Sudanese peace talks in Juba and said, “I note with encouragement that a cessation of hostilities agreement between the Transitional Government of Sudan and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) was reached since 21 October 2019. I echo the Secretary-General’s appeal and urge the Sudanese parties to recognize the gravity of the situation which the Secretary-General describes as ‘the true fight of our lives,’ and reach a comprehensive peace agreement as soon as possible.”

“I therefore take this opportunity, at this critical juncture in the history of Sudan to once again urge Abdul Wahid Al-Nur, the leader of the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA/AW), to join the process as the Coronavirus pandemic requires an absolutely united front to save lives. I stand with the people of Sudan at this critical hour, and assure the nation of UNAMID’s support,” Mr. Mamabolo concluded.
