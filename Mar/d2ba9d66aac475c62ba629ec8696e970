                            Overview and situation analysis



As of 24th March 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has exceeded 372,000 in 195 countries, territories and areas. According to the WHO situation report of 24th March 2020, the total number of deaths globally stands at over 16,000. Italy is still the country with the most deaths, followed by Spain and United Kingdom; and the epidemic does not show signs of slowing down in most places. Transmission varies from one place to another, and is highly influenced by response measures adopted by each country. Almost all countries have registered confirmed cases, with the rate of infection rising rapidly, and further restrictive measures being taken. According to WHO, Europe remains the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significant increase in numbers and community transmission of new infections.
Community transmission is now occurring to different degrees on all continents. Containment remains a major challenge worldwide and countries are gradually implementing stricter measures.
Flight bookings and arrivals into Seychelles have declined significantly and this is already showing signs of adverse impact on the local economy. However, with the outbreak escalating globally, there is a possibility of having new cases of COVID-19 amongst passengers who have already arrived in Seychelles.

Seychelles needs to continue focusing its resources on dealing with the current situation locally and mitigating the impact of the outbreak on its citizens.
