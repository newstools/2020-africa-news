As you are aware, the world today is facing a serious health crisis caused by COVID-19, also known as the Coronavirus. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this a pandemic, which means that it is affecting the whole world, and Ethiopia now has confirmed eleven cases as of today. They are all in quarantine in a special facility in Addis Ababa. This communication is to inform you how UNHCR and its partners are responding to COVID-19 in Ethiopia, and what you can do to mitigate the risk of spreading the virus in your communities.
