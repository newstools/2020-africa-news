CAPE TOWN, South Africa, June 30, 2020/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The total number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the North West Province as of Monday, 29 June 2020 is 3931. Since the last update, 208 recoveries were recorded taking total number of recoveries in the Province to 641.



During the process of data harmonization and data cleaning process, the following adjustments were made:




	Two of the 16 unallocated cases that appeared in the previous report were allocated to Rustenburg.
	One case was reallocated from Naledi Local Municipality to JB Marks Local Municipality.




To date, a total of 2611 contacts were identified of which 2404 contacts have been successfully traced. The untraced contacts are from the new cases. A total of 1281 contacts have completed 14 days monitoring period. Only 90 contacts tested positive.

Regrettably, we announce two new COVID-19 related deaths. All new deaths were recorded in the City of Matlosana, Dr Kenneth Kaunda District. This takes the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the Province to seven. May the souls of the departed Rest In Peace.

MEC Mododa Sambatha wishes to thank the healthcare workers who treated the deceased.
