                            The Africa Medical Supplies Platform (AMSP) adopted as a single online marketplace to enable the supply of COVID-19-related critical medical equipment in Africa was developed under the leadership of African Union Special Envoy, Strive Masiyiwa and powered by Janngo (Janngo.africa) on behalf of the African Union’s Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and in partnership with African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and other leading African & International Corporations, Institutions & Foundations.



The Africa Medical Supplies Platform (AMSP) unlocks immediate access to an African & global base of vetted manufacturers and procurement strategic partners and enables African Union Member States to purchase certified medical equipment such as diagnostic kits, PPE and clinical management devices with improved cost effectiveness & transparency. The platform serves as a unique interface enabling volume aggregation, quota management, payment facilitation as well as logistics & transportation to ensure equitable & efficient access to critical supplies for African governments. The Afreximbank will facilitate payments while logistics partners including African national carriers, global freight forwarders will expedite delivery.
                                Africa is leading the way with this online solution to ensure all of our governments get access to PPEs and other urgent medical supplies they need, at fair prices
                            

“The Africa Medical Supply Platform is just one innovation that African countries have developed ourselves, to help mitigate the devastating impact of this pandemic that threatens both the health of our people and our national economies. We are already getting requests from other parts of the world to franchise the AMSP concept,” said Special Envoy Strive Masiyiwa. He adds “Africa is leading the way with this online solution to ensure all of our governments get access to PPEs and other urgent medical supplies they need, at fair prices.”

“We commit to providing market intelligence on where the manufacturers are, facilitating pooled procurement when financial resources are made available through this initiative, and distributing these products to respective African destinations,” said Dr John Nkengasong, Director of Africa CDC.

“As a mission-driven organization, we are committed to serving our beloved continent in these trying times, leveraging Janngo’s 3 main pillars :


	our venture building capabilities, technology expertise & cross-border marketplace track-record to enable this platform initiative under the leadership of Special Envoy Strive Masiyiwa;
