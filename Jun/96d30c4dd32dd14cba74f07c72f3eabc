VIRGINIA, United States of America, June 11, 2020/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The Internet Society Foundation (ISOCFoundation.org) has launched a new grant programme that aims to expand economic growth, improve health outcomes, and increase educational opportunities by supporting individuals and communities to more knowledgeably and skillfully use the Internet. In its pilot year, the Strengthening Communities, Improving Lives and Livelihoods (SCILLS) programme (bit.ly/2AX8Rig) is open to eligible organizations in Bangladesh, Colombia, and Senegal; with expansion to additional countries planned in coming years. Grants of up to $150,000 will be awarded to organizations for projects lasting up to 24 months. 
                                The SCILLS programme aims to narrow this gap by supporting organizations whose work enables communities to acquire critical digital skills
                            



The programme is open for applications (bit.ly/30tBs9y) between 9 June and 5 July, and the grantees will be announced in early September.

“Though internet access has increased tremendously in the past decade, a gap persists between those who have the knowledge and skills to use the internet to tangibly improve their lives, and those who don’t,” said Sarah Armstrong, Executive Director of the Internet Society Foundation. “The SCILLS programme aims to narrow this gap by supporting organizations whose work enables communities to acquire critical digital skills, skills that when harnessed, have the potential to improve a community’s education, health, and economic outcomes.”
