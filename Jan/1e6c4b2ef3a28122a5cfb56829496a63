                            Manhanga Primary School in Kariba District now has a greatly improved educational environment thanks to funding from Japan. On 21 January, the Deputy Head of Mission, Mr Kenichi Kasahara, attended the handover ceremony of newly completed facilities, including three classroom blocks, a teacherâ€™s house with solar power, and a fence. These were provided through a project implemented by a local NGO, Tony Waite Organization.


                                Previously, the school was lacking basic facilities, and the students and teachers had to conduct their lessons in makeshift classrooms with insufficient desks and chairs
