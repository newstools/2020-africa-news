After all votes are tallied, players will be ranked in each conference by position (guard and frontcourt) within each of the three voting groups – fan votes, player votes and media votes.  Each player’s score will be calculated by averaging his weighted rank from the fan votes, the player votes and the media votes.  The two guards and three frontcourt players with the best score in each conference will be named NBA All-Star Game starters.  Fan voting will serve as the tiebreaker for players in a position group with the same score.



NBA All-Star Voting presented by Google began on Dec. 25 and runs until Monday, Jan. 20.  The third and final fan voting update will be shared on Thursday, Jan. 16. 



During the voting period, five “2-for-1 Days” allow fans to have their votes count twice.  The remaining 2-for-1 Days, which are designated 12 a.m. – 11:59 p.m. ET, take place tomorrow (Jan. 10), Jan. 16 and Jan. 20 through all voting platforms.  The other 2-for-1 Days were held on Jan. 2 and Jan. 3.
